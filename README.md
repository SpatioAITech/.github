🚀 What We Do
We fuse satellite imagery, machine learning, and socio-economic indicators to build solutions for climate resilience and sustainable resource management across Africa.
Our key focus areas include:

Forest Monitoring: Track deforestation & degradation with AI-powered satellite image analysis (90% accuracy).

Water Resource Intelligence: Predict floods, droughts, and map aquifers.

Land Degradation Monitoring: Early warning systems for soil erosion and desertification.

Climate Risk Intelligence: Predictive analytics dashboards for extreme weather risks.

Smart Agriculture: Precision farming tools for crop health and yield prediction.

Policy Dashboards: Data visualization aligned with the Kenya AI Strategy 2025–2030.
