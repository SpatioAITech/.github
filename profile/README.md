## 🚀 What We Do

We combine satellite imagery, machine learning, and socio-economic indicators to build end-to-end solutions that support climate resilience and sustainable development.  

Our key focus areas include:
- **Forest Monitoring:** AI-powered tracking of deforestation and forest degradation with 90% accuracy.
- **Water Resource Intelligence:** Predict floods, droughts, and groundwater resilience.
- **Land Degradation Monitoring:** Early warning systems for soil erosion and desertification.
- **Climate Risk Intelligence:** Predictive dashboards for droughts, floods, and extreme weather events.
- **Smart Agriculture:** Precision farming tools for crop health, irrigation, and yield prediction.
- **Policy Dashboards:** Data visualization tools aligned with the Kenya AI Strategy 2025–2030.
